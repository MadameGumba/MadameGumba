- 👋 Hi, I’m @MadameGumba AKA Liz
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to collaborate on projects while making excellent use of the extensive tools GitHub has to offer, and of course, testing my skills while having fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cybersecurity analysis and Linux Administration.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project, with users who love to teach so I can enhance my knowledge base.
- 📫 How to reach me via email...but you must ask...Thanks!
- 😄 Pronouns: She\Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love movies, love racing my car from time to time, and learning as much as I can in almost every known subject from Space exploration, to highspeed drifting.
